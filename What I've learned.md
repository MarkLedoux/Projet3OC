# Projet3OC

What I've learned: 

This project enabled me to:  
- Become more familiar with OOP concepts and terminology
- Learn to think of what i want to do when building the code of an app
- Think of code as problems to solve in order to reach a desired result
- Split large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks which take less time to complete 
- Understand more about concepts in OOP I still had trouble with
- Organize how my approach of coding in segments to solve one after the other to increase efficiency and take less time to code large portions.
